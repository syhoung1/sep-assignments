The heap sort has to heapify the data first before it is able to sort, so
its performance suffers because of that.

Bucket sort is faster than heap sort and is very fast if the range of the
buckets is very small, since there won't be any additional sorting left to do
in each bucket.

Quick sort is the fastest out of these three because each time it sorts through
a subarray, the amount of work it has to do is decreased by 1/2.
