1. 
   *I tested the graphs using 10k instead of 100k because the compiler stack
   overflows at 100k for BST.
   
   Heap: 
    .18 seconds to insert 10k numbers
    .001 seconds to find integer 5000 using bfs
    .0002 seconds to delete the integer 5000
   Binary Search Tree:
    4.9 seconds to insert 10k numbers, compiler gave stack level too deep error
    at 100k
    1.05 seconds to find integer 5k
    .03 seconds to delete integer 5k

2.  Binary search trees are good for general use because they run at O(logn) 
    time. Heaps are good for finding maximums and minimum values in a dataset
    due to the way they are organized. Heaps can find maximums or minimums at
    constant time.
